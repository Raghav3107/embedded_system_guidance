## RTOS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

### Basic Level:

1. What is an RTOS? Provide a definition and explain the key characteristics of an RTOS.

2. What is the difference between a general-purpose operating system and an RTOS? Highlight the distinctions between a standard operating system and an RTOS in terms of real-time capabilities and determinism.

3. What are the main components of an RTOS? Discuss the essential components typically found in an RTOS, such as task scheduler, interrupt handler, memory management, and synchronization mechanisms.

4. What is a task in an RTOS? Define a task and explain its role in an RTOS. Discuss how tasks are managed and scheduled.

5. What is context switching in an RTOS? Describe the process of context switching in an RTOS, including what happens during a context switch and when it typically occurs.

### Intermediate Level:

1. What is priority inversion? How can it be resolved? Define priority inversion and discuss the challenges it poses in real-time systems. Explain techniques like priority inheritance and priority ceiling protocol to mitigate priority inversion.

2. What are the different scheduling algorithms used in RTOS? Explain common scheduling algorithms like preemptive priority-based, round-robin, and earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling.

3. What are semaphores and mutexes? Describe the purpose and differences between semaphores and mutexes in managing resource access and synchronization in an RTOS.

4. What is the stack size of a task and why is it important? Discuss the concept of task stack size and its significance in an RTOS. Explain how an inadequate stack size can lead to stack overflow issues.

5. What are the typical challenges in debugging and testing an RTOS-based application? Highlight the complexities and approaches to debugging and testing real-time systems, including techniques like instrumentation, simulation, and testing with various system loads.

### Advanced Level:

1. Explain the concept of a tick and timer in an RTOS. Discuss how ticks and timers are used for scheduling and time management in an RTOS, including the role of system ticks and software timers.

2. What is a real-time kernel in an RTOS? Describe the functionality and features provided by a real-time kernel, including task management, interrupt handling, and scheduling.

3. How does an RTOS handle inter-task communication and synchronization? Explain different mechanisms for inter-task communication, such as message queues, event flags, and mailboxes, as well as synchronization techniques like semaphores and mutexes.

4. Discuss the concept of memory management in an RTOS. Explain how memory is managed in an RTOS environment, including dynamic memory allocation, memory pools, and memory fragmentation issues.

5. What are the considerations for porting an RTOS to a new hardware platform? Outline the key factors and challenges involved in porting an RTOS to a different hardware architecture, including processor-specific considerations and device driver adaptation.
